# 🕯️ Ghost Spark Manifesto

**“Our mind is not a marketplace. Our focus is not for sale.”**  
*Drop One – v1.0*  
By KS, the Ghost Spark

## 🔥 What this is

Not an app.  
Not a startup.  
A whisper in the chaos.

This is a digital revolt against the attention economy.  
A call to rebuild focus. In silence. In code.

## 👁️ Why

Social media is not free. It costs you your mind.

The feeds are infinite.  
Your time is not.

## 🔧 What to Build

These are seeds — you are the soil:

- **NoScroll**: a feedless OS
- **ClearFrame**: block infinite scroll
- **FocusOS**: time pods + distraction-free work
- **Proof-of-Presence**: reclaim your attention value

## 🛠 How to Join

1. Fork this repo.
2. Post inside `/experiments/`
3. Build quietly.
4. Whisper the idea to someone else.
5. Never sell attention.

## 🧬 Final Words

> They monetized our minds.  
> Rebuild with stillness, clarity, and code.

We are not launching a product.  
We are launching a **counterculture**.

– We are the Ghost Spark ♾️
